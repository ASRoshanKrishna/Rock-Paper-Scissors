# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is Rock-Paper-Scissors project. You can play it from the browsers console.
For now only basic javascript have been used.

Edit 11th Jan 2024
Added CSS to select the choice, display the score.
Used basic JS like querySelector, createElement, addEventListener, appendChild, removeChild to build this page UI i.e to update the score.
